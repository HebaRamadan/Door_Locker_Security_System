# Door_Locker_Security_System
Door Locker Security System consists of two ECUs. The first ECU called HMI responsible for interfacing with the user and the second ECU called Control responsible for the system operations and control. In the project I implemented the following drivers: keypad, LCD, Servo Motor, UART, Timer, I2C, and External EEPROM.
